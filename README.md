## Design Flaws

### Not Responsive

It works very well on my laptop screen (1920x1080p) but when I run this on my emulator or my smartphone (OnePlus 6T) with the same resolution the webpage does not adapt.

### No Profile Change Options

Now say suppose the account is mis-spelt due to human error, then in the current website there is no place to modify the changes. So the only way to change that is to get in contact with them via a phone call, that takes forever (minimum 20 minutes) to update. My point of view in this case is it would be make more sense to add a modify option so that the user can make those changes then and there on the spot.
